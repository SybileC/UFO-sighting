# UFO Sighting

- Wrote code that appends a table to the web page and adds new rows of data from UFO dataset for each UFO sighting.

- Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input (UFO-Level-1).
